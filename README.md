# Pimlico
Pimlico is a toolbox for Delphi to write microservices, plugins and much more.

Please read [this post](http://www.kouraklis.com/?p=972) for an introduction to Pimlio.

I hope you find the component useful. If you have any comments or ideas, have spotted bugs or have any suggestions about changes to the code use the "Issues" tab on github or drop me an email at [this email](j_kour@hotmail.com)

Thanks!

John
